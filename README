Colbert

*Colbert* is not about Stephen Colbert. It is serious matter.

The name is a homage to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the Minister of Finance of France in 17th century also known for being the father of the modern accountancy.


The big disclaimer(s)
=====================

I don't know shit about accountancy. I am running a very small company since 2011 and there is two things I want to avoid for my accountancy :

1. to throw 3k€/year to pay someone Porsche ;
2. to learn a terrible closed source piece of accountancy software instead of understanding the roots.

So I first decided to write a *Django* project to record my expenses, my incomes and automagically generate the client's invoices.
That worked pretty well and I am still using it for the *LaTeX* invoices.

But when the administrative procedures are falling you are facing the reality. You cannot do accountancy without understanding accountancy.

I decided to restart from scratch with a very light architecture while learning the *discipline* allowing me to quickly adapt to the new knowledge I was going to acquire during the development process. Learning accountancy is a big task and this is illusion to think that you can learn first and modelize it in a second step.

And you know what ? The concepts behind the accountancy as they were thought four centuries ago are pure beauty. As beautiful as Unix' pipes.
Simple, universal and powerful. 

It is all about *inputs* and *outputs*. Every single input must be balanced by an output of the same amount and *vice-versa*.

The idea behind the *Plan Comptable Général* (Chart of accounts I think) is of the same blood.
In Unix, everything is a file. In accountancy, everything is an account.

You can see accounts like a filesystem. You can create as much leafs and forks as you need.


This is a work in progress and the product is at his very early stage. A lot of refactoring in the code will happen but for now I keep it as much simple as I can.
This is not yet an object-oriented program with metaclasses and other fancy concepts. 
I need to keep the codebase easy to move as long as I have not validate my knowledge which may take one or two years.

Some stuffs are hard-coded, this is a proof-of-concept.


All that prose to say «don't blind-trust this software if you want to use it».


Being french, this software is written for french accountancy with french words. But the concept seems to be universal and with a little
effort you can fork it to match what you need in your own country.

I am using the BSD implementation of your favorite tools (*sed*, *grep* etc).


The concepts
============


*Colbert* is all about human-readable text files. *RestructuredText* and *JSON* files. You organize those files in a logical manner and extensively
use *Makefiles* to generate other files and produce beautiful *LaTeX* and *PDF* outputs.

The core of accountancy is *le livre-journal* (grow a mustache and try to pronounce it with a glass of *Bordeaux Haut-Médoc* in your right-hand).
This is our «database» where every single operation occuring in your business is recorded. 

This book is usualy splitted in several ones to regroup together operations by type. I don't need that, so I don't do that.


my organization is the following ::
